# Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

Example project in example data into an Apache Cassandra NoSQL database using
Python and CQL queries

## Running this project's ETL pipeline

Simply run the notebook `etl_pipeline.ipynb` to load the CSV files from 
`event_data` into Cassandra cluster.

Three example queries are demonstrated to load the data and then confirmed by
looking at specific select statements.
